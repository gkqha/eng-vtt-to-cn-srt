2
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:09,968
]我想讨论为什么编程语言课程实际上是在Coursera，三个
I want to discuss why the Programming Languages course is actually on Coursera, 

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:14,030
疗程的A部分，B部分，C部分，为什么我们做出这一决定，
three courses Part A, Part B, Part C, why we made that decision and 

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,194
并三块如何结合在一起的。
how the three pieces fit together. 

5
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:20,314
因此，我们把它分成三个部分最大的原因是因为它是一个
So the biggest reason we split it into three parts is because it's a large 

6
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:22,486
大的过程中，有大量的材料。
course, there's a lot of material. 

7
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:26,490
谁已经完成了整个过程，部分A，B和Part C，人们
People who've finished the entire course, Part A, Part B and Part C, 

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,651
100〜200小时左右的地方度过的。
have spent somewhere between 100 and 200 hours. 

9
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:34,946
这很大程度上取决于人的速度有多快，他们经过材料。
It very much depends on the person and how quickly they go through the material. 

10
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:38,765
所以它只是好像很多，一路上最现代化的课程，
And so it just seemed like a lot, the way most modern courses, 

11
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:42,521
在线课程，在这一点上呼吁所有的一门课程。
online courses are at this point to call that all one course. 

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:45,766
这是什么，对应于一些学生在我的大学做
This is something that corresponds to something that students in 

13
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:47,241
在10或11周的
my university do over a 10 or 

14
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:51,430
时间，而他们并没有试图做很多其他的事情在他们的生活，
11 week period while they're not trying to do a lot of other things in their lives, 

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,689
虽然他们是在同时服用其他几个课程。
although they are taking a couple other courses at the same time. 

16
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,777
现在，拆分起来是不容易的，我做的。
Now splitting it up was not easy for me to do. 

17
00:00:57,777 --> 00:01:02,946
如果你能想像写一本小说，然后有一个
If you can imagine writing a novel and then having someone say, 

18
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:06,850
人说，我真的只是想读前几章。
I really only want to read the first few chapters. 

19
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,350
这是一种我觉得怎么分手了课程。
That's kind of how I feel splitting up the course. 

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,967
它确实都结合在一起，
It really does all fit together, 

21
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:15,081
也有交叉的主题，只有真正弄懂，一旦你到达终点。
there are cross-cutting themes that only really make sense once you get to the end. 

22
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:19,563
还有，一旦你得到那个绑在一起巧妙的事情分为B和Part C.
There are neat things that tie together once you get into Part B and Part C. 

23
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:23,278
有对比，我们不能做，直到在病程晚期。
There are contrasts that we can't do until late in the course. 

24
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:27,844
而总体而言，我已经投入了很多心思的是在这个过程
And overall, I've put a lot of thought into what is in this course and 

25
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:32,724
中同样重要的，什么不是，就什么都有了某种打包为一个
just as importantly, what is not, to have it all sort of packaged up as one 

26
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:36,698
整体，告诉一致的故事，从开始到结束的。
piece that tells a consistent story from beginning to end. 

27
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:41,375
我不能强调不够，我是多么希望你们所有人参加所有的
And I cannot emphasize enough how much I want all of you to participate all 

28
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,687
方式，通过对部分C的结束
the way through to the end of Part C. 

29
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,893
而且，事实上，这里的目的不是将其分为三个课程，
And, indeed, the goal here was not to split it into three courses that try to 

30
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:48,879
尽量让更
make more money or 

31
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,115
多的钱，或让你觉得你做的三倍多，你实际上做。
make you think you're doing three times more than you're actually doing. 

32
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:56,691
通常，当我说的过程中，我的意思是一切。
And usually, when I say the course, I mean everything. 

33
00:01:56,691 --> 00:02:01,544
所以我在这里所做的基本上是认为我不应该分裂它，但显然我们
So what I've done here is basically argue that I shouldn't have split it up, 

34
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:05,740
没有，所以现在让我解释一下为什么我们做的原因。
but obviously we did, so let me now explain the reasons why we did. 

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,890
最大的一个是，有更多的只是物质和它的更具挑战性，
The biggest one is that there's just more material and it's more challenging and 

36
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,930
你在某种意义上应得的信贷完成三个疗程的材料价值，
you in some sense deserve the credit for completing three courses worth of material 

37
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,610
而且我们把它分解的地方是合理的中间里程碑。
and the places where we split it are reasonable intermediate milestones. 

38
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,660
他们的地方，你应该感到很自豪越来越远的，
They are places where you should feel very proud of getting that far and 

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,930
如果你选择不走的更远，你会学到一些东西，
if you choose to go no further, you will have learned something and 

40
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,750
它们的排序是合理的停靠站，使意义。
they sort of are reasonable stopping points that make sense. 

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,000
所以，你应该承认为，它的东西，当我们有一切融合在一起，
So you deserve recognition for that, it's something that when we had 

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,500
因为我们没有，当我们第一次提出这个MOOC，我们没有这个。
everything together, as we did when we first offered this MOOC, we didn't have. 

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,860
因此，我认为这是在一个非常好的方向迈出的一大步。
And so I think that's a great step in a really good direction. 

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,742
它也会给你一个机会休息一下，如果你愿意。
It will also give you a chance to take a break, if you will. 

45
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:52,457
当你经过一个部分，你真的不想失去势头。
As you go through Part A, you really don't want to lose momentum. 

46
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:56,676
你想要做的每件作品中那种连续两周的课程，
You want to do each piece of the course in sort of consecutive weeks, so 

47
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,098
让你可以跟踪一切。
that you can keep track of everything. 

48
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:03,719
但是，如果你想开始部分B.起飞前几个星期或一个月关闭
But if you wanted to take a couple weeks off or a month off before starting Part B. 

49
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,862
那么，它可能是一个有点艰难记得你在哪里，
Well, it might be a little tough to remember where you were and 

50
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:10,790
并再次上手，但同样的，因为它是一个合理的停车点，
get started again but, again, because it's a reasonable stopping point, 

51
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,983
我倒认为这使得有很大的意义。
I actually think that makes a lot of sense. 

52
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:17,842
因此，这是一种方式一种是让你通过整个课程以较慢
And so it's a way that kind of let you go through the overall course at 

53
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:22,018
的速度，通过按一定的速度为A部分去排序，
a slower pace by going sort of at a certain pace for Part A and 

54
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:25,791
然后采取B部分之前休息之类的事情。
then taking a break before Part B that sort of thing. 

55
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,585
所以它是如何分解的术语，我说不幸的
So in terms of how it breaks down, I say unfortunately, 

56
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:34,290
是，该课程的每个部分在不同的编程语言来完成。
each part of the course is done in a different programming language. 

57
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,160
我说不幸，因为它反馈到这种想法，课程
I say unfortunate because it feeds back into this idea that the parts of 

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,835
的部分是哪里我一直在强调，他们是真的不语言。
courses are about the languages where I keep emphasizing that they're really not. 

59
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:45,876
但无论如何，这是事情是如何打破。
But nonetheless, that is how things break down. 

60
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:48,849
我还要强调的是，我们并没有打破它投入三分，对不对？
I should also emphasize that we didn't break it into thirds, right? 

61
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:53,832
我们选择了合理的停靠站，并制定出的方法
We picked the reasonable stopping points, and the way that worked out 

62
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:58,067
是B部分绝对是三个部分的最大部分。
is Part B is definitely the biggest part of the three parts. 

63
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:01,978
而且我们可以把一个部分成两个较小的碎片，也许我们可以，
And could we divide Part A into two smaller pieces, maybe we could but 

64
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:06,300
但我没有看到一个自然的突破点，所以我没有，没事吧？
I don't see a natural breaking point, so I didn't, all right? 

65
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,710
因此，这打破了办法是，A部分有三个家庭作业，
So the way this breaks down is that Part A has three homework assignments and 

66
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,300
然后有没有家庭作业，但确实有考试第四
then a fourth substantial section that has no homework assignment but 

67
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:20,840
实体部，所以完成A部分，是当然的真正四大单元。
does have an exam, so to finish Part A, is really four major units of the course. 

68
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,290
然后，B部分只有两个单位，所以对A部分的一半大小，
Then Part B is only two more units, so about half the size of Part A, although, 

69
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,620
但是，这些单位的第二个有什么通常被认为在使用过程中
the second of those units has what's usually considered the most challenging, 

70
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,500
最具挑战性，也是最有价值的功课。
and also most rewarding homework in the course. 

71
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,752
然后，C部分，在那里我们学习面向对象编程，然后比较，
And then Part C, where we study object oriented programming and then compare and 

72
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:41,504
并与我们在A部分和B部分做函数式编程对比回来，
contrast it back with the functional programming that we do in Part A and 

73
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:44,778
刚刚另外两个家庭作业，但再一次期末考试。
Part B, has just another two homeworks but then a final exam. 

74
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:50,723
这考试主要集中在零部件B和C.
And that exam focuses mostly on Parts B and C. 

75
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,952
因为你会发现B部分没有考试。
because you'll notice Part B doesn't have an exam. 

76
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:56,914
而是指一点点与零件对比，因为当你到课程结束，
But refers a little bit to contrast with Part A, because when you get to the end of 

77
00:04:56,914 --> 00:05:00,127
你会看到，这是应该做适当的事情。
the course you'll see that that's an appropriate thing to do. 

78
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:04,144
这么干脆，东西都在三个部分一个疗程。
So altogether, things are one course in three parts. 

79
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,885
我希望你明白，。
I hope you appreciate that. 

80
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:10,370
这也许很明显，但我会说出来，你不能真正做到B部分没有一个
It's perhaps obvious, but I'll say it, that you can't really do Part B without 

81
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,360
部分，你不能真正做到C部分没有A部分和
Part A and you can't really do Part C without Parts A and 

82
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,850
B部分，因为他们往往是指回前面的部分。
Part B because they often refer back to earlier parts. 

83
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,340
这就是我们如何划分的事情了这个
And that's the story of how we divided things up and 

84
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,300
故事，我们希望您充分利用你现有的材料，
we hope that you make the most of the material available to you 

85
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,950
以最有意义到你的方式。
in the way that makes the most sense to you.
