2
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:09,968
I want to discuss why the Programming
Languages course is actually on Coursera,

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:14,030
three courses Part A, Part B, Part C,
why we made that decision and

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,194
how the three pieces fit together.

5
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:20,314
So the biggest reason we split it into
three parts is because it's a large

6
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:22,486
course, there's a lot of material.

7
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:26,490
People who've finished the entire course,
Part A, Part B and Part C,

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,651
have spent somewhere between 100 and
200 hours.

9
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:34,946
It very much depends on the person and
how quickly they go through the material.

10
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:38,765
And so it just seemed like a lot,
the way most modern courses,

11
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:42,521
online courses are at this point
to call that all one course.

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:45,766
This is something that corresponds
to something that students in

13
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:47,241
my university do over a 10 or

14
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:51,430
11 week period while they're not trying to
do a lot of other things in their lives,

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,689
although they are taking a couple
other courses at the same time.

16
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,777
Now splitting it up was not easy for
me to do.

17
00:00:57,777 --> 00:01:02,946
If you can imagine writing a novel and
then having someone say,

18
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:06,850
I really only want to read
the first few chapters.

19
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,350
That's kind of how I feel
splitting up the course.

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,967
It really does all fit together,

21
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:15,081
there are cross-cutting themes that only
really make sense once you get to the end.

22
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:19,563
There are neat things that tie together
once you get into Part B and Part C.

23
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:23,278
There are contrasts that we can't
do until late in the course.

24
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:27,844
And overall, I've put a lot of thought
into what is in this course and

25
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:32,724
just as importantly, what is not,
to have it all sort of packaged up as one

26
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:36,698
piece that tells a consistent
story from beginning to end.

27
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:41,375
And I cannot emphasize enough how much
I want all of you to participate all

28
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,687
the way through to the end of Part C.

29
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,893
And, indeed, the goal here was not to
split it into three courses that try to

30
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:48,879
make more money or

31
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,115
make you think you're doing three
times more than you're actually doing.

32
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:56,691
And usually, when I say the course,
I mean everything.

33
00:01:56,691 --> 00:02:01,544
So what I've done here is basically
argue that I shouldn't have split it up,

34
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:05,740
but obviously we did, so
let me now explain the reasons why we did.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,890
The biggest one is that there's just more
material and it's more challenging and

36
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,930
you in some sense deserve the credit for
completing three courses worth of material

37
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,610
and the places where we split it
are reasonable intermediate milestones.

38
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,660
They are places where you should feel
very proud of getting that far and

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,930
if you choose to go no further,
you will have learned something and

40
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,750
they sort of are reasonable
stopping points that make sense.

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,000
So you deserve recognition for that,
it's something that when we had

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,500
everything together, as we did when we
first offered this MOOC, we didn't have.

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,860
And so I think that's a great
step in a really good direction.

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,742
It will also give you a chance
to take a break, if you will.

45
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:52,457
As you go through Part A,
you really don't want to lose momentum.

46
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:56,676
You want to do each piece of the course
in sort of consecutive weeks, so

47
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,098
that you can keep track of everything.

48
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:03,719
But if you wanted to take a couple weeks
off or a month off before starting Part B.

49
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,862
Well, it might be a little tough
to remember where you were and

50
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:10,790
get started again but, again,
because it's a reasonable stopping point,

51
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,983
I actually think that
makes a lot of sense.

52
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:17,842
And so it's a way that kind of let
you go through the overall course at

53
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:22,018
a slower pace by going sort of
at a certain pace for Part A and

54
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:25,791
then taking a break before
Part B that sort of thing.

55
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,585
So in terms of how it breaks down,
I say unfortunately,

56
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:34,290
each part of the course is done in
a different programming language.

57
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,160
I say unfortunate because it feeds
back into this idea that the parts of

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,835
courses are about the languages where I
keep emphasizing that they're really not.

59
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:45,876
But nonetheless,
that is how things break down.

60
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:48,849
I should also emphasize that we
didn't break it into thirds, right?

61
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:53,832
We picked the reasonable stopping points,
and the way that worked out

62
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:58,067
is Part B is definitely the biggest
part of the three parts.

63
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:01,978
And could we divide Part A into two
smaller pieces, maybe we could but

64
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:06,300
I don't see a natural breaking point,
so I didn't, all right?

65
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,710
So the way this breaks down is that
Part A has three homework assignments and

66
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,300
then a fourth substantial section
that has no homework assignment but

67
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:20,840
does have an exam, so to finish Part A,
is really four major units of the course.

68
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,290
Then Part B is only two more units, so
about half the size of Part A, although,

69
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,620
the second of those units has what's
usually considered the most challenging,

70
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,500
and also most rewarding
homework in the course.

71
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,752
And then Part C, where we study object
oriented programming and then compare and

72
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:41,504
contrast it back with the functional
programming that we do in Part A and

73
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:44,778
Part B, has just another two homeworks but
then a final exam.

74
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:50,723
And that exam focuses
mostly on Parts B and C.

75
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,952
because you'll notice Part B
doesn't have an exam.

76
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:56,914
But refers a little bit to contrast with
Part A, because when you get to the end of

77
00:04:56,914 --> 00:05:00,127
the course you'll see that that's
an appropriate thing to do.

78
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:04,144
So altogether,
things are one course in three parts.

79
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,885
I hope you appreciate that.

80
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:10,370
It's perhaps obvious, but I'll say it,
that you can't really do Part B without

81
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,360
Part A and you can't really
do Part C without Parts A and

82
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,850
Part B because they often
refer back to earlier parts.

83
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,340
And that's the story of how
we divided things up and

84
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,300
we hope that you make the most
of the material available to you

85
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,950
in the way that makes
the most sense to you.
